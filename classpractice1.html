    Signature of Gandhi
    Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[c] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)[2] was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political  <strong>GUJRAT</strong>ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence  <i></i>fromBritish rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.[3] <b>GUJRAT</b>
    
    Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi <i>GUJRAT</i> trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the Ibar at the age of 22. After two uncertain years <em>GUJRATY</em>in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. Here, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasant , farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land tax.</p>
